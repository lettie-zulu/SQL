-- Consider the following two tables from a database youâ€™re making to keep
-- track of your vinyl LP collection. Start by reviewing these CREATE TABLE
-- statements.

-- The albums table includes information specific to the overall collection
-- of songs on the disc. The songs table catalogs each track on the album.
-- Each song has a title and its own artist column, because each song might.
-- feature its own collection of artists.

CREATE TABLE albums (
    album_id bigserial,
    album_catalog_code varchar(100),
    album_title text,
    album_artist text,
    album_time interval,
    album_release_date date,
    album_genre varchar(40),
    album_description text
);

CREATE TABLE songs (
    song_id bigserial,
    song_title text,
    song_artist text,
    album_id bigint
);

-- Use the tables to answer these questions:

-- 1. Modify these CREATE TABLE statements to include primary and foreign keys
-- plus additional constraints on both tables. Explain why you made your
-- choices.

CREATE TABLE albums (
    album_id bigserial,
    album_catalog_code varchar(100) NOT NULL,
    album_title text NOT NULL,
    album_artist text NOT NULL,
    album_release_date date,
    album_genre varchar(40),
    album_description text,
    CONSTRAINT album_id_key PRIMARY KEY (album_id),
    CONSTRAINT release_date_check CHECK (album_release_date > '1/1/1925')
);

CREATE TABLE songs (
    song_id bigserial,
    song_title text NOT NULL,
    song_artist text NOT NULL,
    album_id bigint REFERENCES albums (album_id),
    CONSTRAINT song_id_key PRIMARY KEY (song_id)
);

-- Answers:
-- a) Both tables get a primary key using surrogate key id values that are
-- auto-generated via serial data types.

-- b) The songs table references albums via a foreign key constraint.

-- c) In both tables, the title and artist columns cannot be empty, which
-- is specified via a NOT NULL constraint. We assume that every album and
-- song should at minimum have that information.

-- d) In albums, the album_release_date column has a CHECK constraint
-- because it would be likely impossible for us to own an LP made before 1925.


-- 2. Instead of using album_id as a surrogate key for your primary key, are
-- there any columns in albums that could be useful as a natural key? What would
-- you have to know to decide?

-- Answer:
-- We could consider the album_catalog_code. We would have to answer yes to
-- these questions:
-- - Is it going to be unique across all albums released by all companies?
-- - Will we always have one?


-- 3. To speed up queries, which columns are good candidates for indexes?

-- Answer:
-- Primary key columns get indexes by default, but we should add an index
-- to the album_id foreign key column in the songs table because we'll use
-- it in table joins. It's likely that we'll query these tables to search
-- by titles and artists, so those columns in both tables should get indexes
-- too. The album_release_date in albums also is a candidate if we expect
-- to perform many queries that include date ranges.
