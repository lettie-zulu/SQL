-- Chapter 11: Working with Dates and Times
--------------------------------------------------------------

-- 1. Using the New York City taxi data, calculate the length of each ride using
-- the pickup and drop-off timestamps. Sort the query results from the longest
-- ride to the shortest. Do you notice anything about the longest or shortest
-- trips that you might want to ask city officials about?

-- Answer: More than 480 of the trips last more than 10 hours, which seems
-- excessive. Moreover, two records have drop-off times before the pickup time,
-- and several have pickup and drop-off times that are the same. It's worth
-- asking whether these records have timestamp errors.

SELECT
    trip_id,
    tpep_pickup_datetime,
    tpep_dropoff_datetime,
    tpep_dropoff_datetime - tpep_pickup_datetime AS length_of_ride
FROM nyc_yellow_taxi_trips_2016_06_01
ORDER BY length_of_ride DESC;

-- 2. Using the AT TIME ZONE keywords, write a query that displays the date and
-- time for London, Johannesburg, Moscow, and Melbourne the moment January 1,
-- 2100, arrives in New York City.

-- Answer:

SELECT '2100-01-01 00:00:00-05' AT TIME ZONE 'US/Eastern' AS new_york,
       '2100-01-01 00:00:00-05' AT TIME ZONE 'Europe/London' AS london,
       '2100-01-01 00:00:00-05' AT TIME ZONE 'Africa/Johannesburg' AS johannesburg,
       '2100-01-01 00:00:00-05' AT TIME ZONE 'Europe/Moscow' AS moscow,
       '2100-01-01 00:00:00-05' AT TIME ZONE 'Australia/Melbourne' AS melbourne;

-- 3. As a bonus challenge, use the statistics functions in Chapter 10 to
-- calculate the correlation coefficient and r-squared values using trip time
-- and the total_amount column in the New York City taxi data, which represents
-- total amount charged to passengers. Do the same with trip_distance and
-- total_amount. Limit the query to rides that last three hours or less.

-- Answer:

SELECT
    round(
          corr(total_amount, (
              date_part('epoch', tpep_dropoff_datetime) -
              date_part('epoch', tpep_pickup_datetime)
                ))::numeric, 2
          ) AS amount_time_corr,
    round(
        regr_r2(total_amount, (
              date_part('epoch', tpep_dropoff_datetime) -
              date_part('epoch', tpep_pickup_datetime)
        ))::numeric, 2
    ) AS amount_time_r2,
    round(
          corr(total_amount, trip_distance)::numeric, 2
          ) AS amount_distance_corr,
    round(
        regr_r2(total_amount, trip_distance)::numeric, 2
    ) AS amount_distance_r2
FROM nyc_yellow_taxi_trips_2016_06_01
WHERE tpep_dropoff_datetime - tpep_pickup_datetime <= '3 hours'::interval;

-- Note: Both correlations are strong, with r values of 0.80 or higher. We'd
-- expect this given that cost of a taxi ride is based on both time and distance.
