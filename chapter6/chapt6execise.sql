-- 1. The table us_counties_2010 contains 3,143 rows, and us_counties_2000 has
-- 3,141. That reflects the ongoing adjustments to county-level geographies that
-- typically result from government decision making. Using appropriate joins and
-- the NULL value, identify which counties don't exist in both tables. For fun,
-- search online to  nd out why theyâ€™re missing

-- Answers:

-- Counties that exist in 2010 data but not 2000 include five county equivalents
-- in Alaska (called boroughs) plus Broomfield County, Colorado.

SELECT c2010.geo_name,
       c2010.state_us_abbreviation,
       c2000.geo_name
FROM us_counties_2010 c2010 LEFT JOIN us_counties_2000 c2000
ON c2010.state_fips = c2000.state_fips
   AND c2010.county_fips = c2000.county_fips
WHERE c2000.geo_name IS NULL;

-- Counties that exist in 2000 data but not 2010 include three county
-- equivalents in Alaska (called boroughs) plus Clifton Forge city, Virginia,
-- which gave up its independent city status in 2001:

SELECT c2010.geo_name,
       c2000.geo_name,
       c2000.state_us_abbreviation
FROM us_counties_2010 c2010 RIGHT JOIN us_counties_2000 c2000
ON c2010.state_fips = c2000.state_fips
   AND c2010.county_fips = c2000.county_fips
WHERE c2010.geo_name IS NULL;

-- 2. Using either the median() or percentile_cont() functions in Chapter 5,
-- determine the median of the percent change in county population.

-- Answer: 3.2%

-- Using median():

SELECT median(round( (CAST(c2010.p0010001 AS numeric(8,1)) - c2000.p0010001)
           / c2000.p0010001 * 100, 1 )) AS median_pct_change
FROM us_counties_2010 c2010 INNER JOIN us_counties_2000 c2000
ON c2010.state_fips = c2000.state_fips
   AND c2010.county_fips = c2000.county_fips;

-- Using percentile_cont():

SELECT percentile_cont(.5)
       WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY round( (CAST(c2010.p0010001 AS numeric(8,1)) - c2000.p0010001)
           / c2000.p0010001 * 100, 1 )) AS percentile_50th
FROM us_counties_2010 c2010 INNER JOIN us_counties_2000 c2000
ON c2010.state_fips = c2000.state_fips
   AND c2010.county_fips = c2000.county_fips;

-- Note: In both examples, you're finding the median of all the
-- county population percent change values.


-- 3. Which county had the greatest percentage loss of population between 2000
-- and 2010? Do you have any idea why? Hint: a weather event happened in 2005.

-- Answer: St. Bernard Parish, La. It and other Louisiana parishes (the county
-- equivalent name in Louisiana) experienced substantial population loss
-- following Hurricane Katrina in 2005.
